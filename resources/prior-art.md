# Token Trees
[token trees]: #token-trees

This line of work relies on an idea variously referred to as "skeleton syntax trees", "tree terms", or "token trees". A reader transforms a stream of characters into tokens grouped by balanced delimiters such as braces. The grouping based on delimiters is coarser than in s-expressions; additional parsing remains necessary to separate out different syntactic forms.

Macros receive a sequence of token trees as their input, parse some portion of it, and return the unparsed remainder of the sequence along with their expansion. The output of a macro expansion step is also a token tree.

The following are in rough chronological order.

# Grammar composition
[grammar composition]: #Grammar-composition

In these systems languages define grammars, which may extend non-terminals found in other grammars. When languages are used together, the productions of the various grammars are composed to form a single grammar that is used to parse the program. Note that these approaches often require that all language extensions used in a given parse be known up-front in order to form the composed grammar.

* [Parsing Composed Grammars with Language Boxes](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/10f8/e0d5590ec702412fcf6dcf4ec6bce402303d.pdf) Section 2, "Parsing Composed Grammars", briefly summarizes some of the challenges with general grammar composition.

## SDF in Spoofax, SugarJ etc.
[SDF]: #SDF

SDF is a DSL for defining general context free grammars. When composing grammars, additional rules can be given to resolve ambiguities resulting from the composition.

# elixir-lang
[elixir-lang]: #elixir-lang

Elixir lies somewhere between the [token trees] approach and a fixed grammar. Many forms build their syntax from generic elements. For example, the syntax of the list comprehensions

```
for n <- [1, 2, 3, 4], do: n * n
```

is composed of a call (`for`), an infix operator (`<-`), and a keyword argument (`do:`). `for` is not part of the parser's grammar. However, some forms such as anonymous functions (`fn`) have more specialized syntax built into the parser.

Mathematica language

> The Mathematica language is a language that uses a non s-expression syntax, but nevertheless feels lispy to use. An application of a function f to arguments x and y is written f[x,y]. This decision makes it easy to use parenthesis for grouping. Using FullForm, TraditionalForm, StandForm and InputForm one can convert between representations of an expression. The full form resembles s-expressions using {} for lists and F[x,y] for applications.
