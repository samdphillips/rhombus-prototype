State of Rhombus

Jack Firth, October 2021

# Motivation

Today, Racket promises language-oriented programming to its users. But
this promise has a constraint: if you want to build a macro-extensible
language, your language has to use S-expressions. This constraint is
unfairly limiting, as telling users “you can build any extensible
language you want, as long as it uses S-expressions” is akin to Henry
Ford telling Model-T buyers “your car can be any color you want, as
long as it’s black.” We’d like to lift this limitation with a new
programming language while taking this opportunity to improve Racket
in backward-incompatible ways.

# Overview

Rhombus is an experiment in building a **macro-extensible**
general-purpose programming language with **conventional surface syntax**
and improved libraries on top of **the Racket platform**.

# Details

By “macro-extensible,” we mean that Rhombus users should be able to
extend the syntax of Rhombus in much the same way that Racket users
can extend the syntax of Racket. Complex syntactic extensions such as
object and class systems, static type checkers, and pattern matching
should be implemented as libraries while still providing a surface
syntax familiar to users of these features in other languages.

By “conventional surface syntax,” we mean conventional to both users
of widely-used programming languages as well as newcomers who are
familiar with basic math notation. This leads us to the following
constraints:

 * Arithmetic is infix, for example, `1+x`
 
 * Function calls are written as a function expression followed by a
   parenthesized comma-separated list of arguments, such as `f(x, y, z)`
 
 * Extra parentheses can be used freely to group things and
   disambiguate, such as `(1 + 2) * 3`, without introducing new
   structures or semantics.
 
 * Dots are used for member selection, like `point.x`
 
 * Syntactic forms are connected by adjacency rather than in a strict
   hierarchy. For example `do { } while ( )` and `x where y = z`. This
   is a kind of “infix” that is broader than just arithmetic.

By “improved libraries,” we mean that Rhombus should not be beholden
to the backward compatibility constraints of Racket. Rhombus should be
free to innovate in providing new standard libraries for features that
are becoming commonplace in other languages, such as generic
collections, stream processing, and asynchronous programming.

By “on top of the Racket platform,” we mean that Rhombus should be a
`#lang` like any other, and it should be possible for users to combine
Rhombus code and libraries with ordinary Racket code and libraries
seamlessly. Where we are now

A few surface syntax proposals have been brainstormed, and the
proposals fit into two broad categories:

 * **C-like** surface syntaxes, which use **braces** and semicolons**
   to convey general structure. Jay’s
   [C-expressions](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/pull/88)
   fit this category.

 * **Python-like** surface syntaxes, which use **colons** and
   **indentation** to convey general structure. Jay’s
   [lexprs](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/pull/114) and
   Matthew’s
   [shrubbery notation](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/pull/122)
   fit this category.

Separately, there’s the question of how much syntactic grouping the
surface syntax should be responsible for versus how much grouping is
left up to the macro system. Three options are possible:

 * The surface syntax is responsible for **all** grouping. This is roughly
   where traditional S-expressions lie, and it’s awkward enough that
   many Lisps relax the S-expressions-for-everything constraint and
   let macros create implicit groupings. For example, Clojure’s `let`
   form implicitly groups binding-expression pairs based on adjacency,
   as in `(let [x 1 y 2] (+ x y))`. Racket’s keyword arguments are a
   similar instance of relaxing this constraint.
   [C-expressions](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/pull/88) are an
   attempt to have “conventional surface syntax” with this property.
 
 * The surface syntax is responsible for **no** grouping. This results in
   a Forth-like syntax where the program is just a flat sequence of
   tokens. This doesn’t satisfy our “conventional surface syntax”
   requirement.
 
 * The surface syntax is responsible for **some** grouping, but not all.
   This requires that the parser understand the program’s bindings and
   expand macros to get a complete picture of a program’s structure.
   Interleaving the parsing of a token stream with macro expansion in
   this fashion is called enforestation, and it allows macros to
   extend the syntax of conventional languages. The
   [Honu](https://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/gpce12-rf.pdf) research
   language pioneered this technique.

# What’s Next

We’ve decided on a **Python-like** surface syntax **with
enforestation**, specifically shrubbery notation, as the first
proposal to advance to the next prototyping stage. This may not be the
final direction that the Rhombus project takes, but it’s the direction
we’re prioritizing for the time being. We made this decision based on
the following factors:

 * Indentation sensitivity a la Python has the advantage that the
   visual grouping on the screen matches grouping for parsing, but it
   also leaves plenty of room for operator- and identifier-driven
   context-sensitive parsing.

 * Matthew tried several experiments and found Python-style notation
   most straightforward to work with, and he’s been the primary
   Rhombus implementor thus far.

Making the “correct” decision about surface syntax isn’t our goal at
this stage. We’re still firmly in the prototyping phase of the Rhombus
project. Our goal is to stake out territory in the design space and
get a deeper understanding of what challenges lie ahead. For that
reason, **we plan to build a language around shrubbery notation**
next. We don’t believe that shrubbery notation is perfect. Still, we
believe that the understanding gained from building a working
programming language with shrubbery notation will help us further
refine shrubbery notation. It will also be vital in determining what
other surface syntaxes are worth exploring.

To build a language, **we need to write libraries**. The libraries we can
work on fall into two broad categories: general-purpose and
special-purpose. General-purpose libraries are necessary to define the
APIs of many other libraries, such as a class system, concurrency
abstractions, or generic collections. Special-purpose libraries are
specific to a narrow (but practically useful) domain, such as text
parsing or theorem proving. Special purpose libraries leverage
domain-specific languages more heavily, so they’ll give us a good
sense of how well shrubbery notation can cooperate with complex DSLs.

**Libraries are an excellent place for new Rhombus contributors to jump
in!** We’re still in the early stages, so exploring multiple approaches
to the same problem domain is valuable. There’s a wide variety of
directions to explore. Below are some we’re already considering to
varying degrees, but we encourage additional proposals.

## Generic collections

General purpose. Volunteers:
[@jackfirth](https://github.com/jackfirth/). Relevant GitHub issues:
[#19](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/issues/19),
[#21](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/issues/21),
[#28](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/issues/28),
[#80](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/issues/80),
[#102](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/issues/102),
[#147](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/issues/147).

Rhombus should provide common data structures for generic collections,
such as lists, sets, maps, and the tools to abstract over different
kinds of collections. Racket’s monomorphic approach to collections has
been a [long-standing complaint](http://programming-puzzler.blogspot.com/2010/08/racket-vs-clojure.html), and it’s one of the few areas the
community almost universally agrees needs improvement.

## Classes and structs

General purpose. Volunteers: none yet. Relevant GitHub issues:
[#57](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/issues/57),
[#76](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/issues/176),
[#151](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/issues/151),
[#152](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/issues/152).

Rhombus should provide a better, more unified system for defining new
data types and interfaces than Racket’s current mishmash of structs,
classes, generics, and structure type properties. There’s a lot of
room to leverage shrubbery notation here, especially if we were to
build some sort of [dot transformer protocol](https://github.com/racket/rhombus-brainstorming/issues/151) for macros to use.

## Other ideas

* Concurrency and parallelism. Can we do better than Racket here?

  - [@jackfirth](https://github.com/jackfirth/) - Software
    transactional memory à la Clojure would be convenient.

* Annotations, types, and contracts. Racket’s runtime contracts and
  Typed Racket’s static types are at two extreme ends of the
  dynamic-static correctness spectrum. Can Rhombus occupy a more
  user-friendly middle ground?

* Multi-language Scribble. If we want Rhombus and Racket libraries to
  be seamlessly interoperable, we need a way for Scribble to translate
  library documentation for different surface syntaxes. In-source
  documentation might be worth exploring here too.

* Redex, but better.
