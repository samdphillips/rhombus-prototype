@title[~tag: "bind-macro"]{Binding and Annotation Macros}

Macros can extend binding-position syntax, too, via @rhombus[bind.rule] and
@rhombus[bind.macro]. In the simplest case, a binding operator is implemented
by expanding to other binding operators, like this definition of @rhombus[$]
as a prefix operator to constrain a pattern to number inputs:

@(rhombusblock:
    import:
      rhombus/macro: no_prefix

    bind.rule '($ $n):
      ~parsed_right
      '($n :: Number)

    val $salary: 100.0

    salary  // prints 100.0
  )

More expressive binding operators can use a lower-level protocol where a
binding is represented by transformers that generate checking and
binding code. It gets complicated, and itâ€™s tied up with the propagation
of static information, so the details are in @secref["bind-macro-protocol"].
After an expressive set of binding forms are implemented with the
low-level interface, however, many others can be implemented though
simple expansion.

The @rhombus[annotation.macro] form is similar to @rhombus[bind.macro], but for
annotations. 

@(rhombusblock:
    use_static_dot

    annotation.macro 'PosnList: 'List.of(Posn)

    fun nth_x(ps -: PosnList, n):
      ps[n].x
  )

For details on the low-level annotation protocol, see @secref["annotation-macro"].
