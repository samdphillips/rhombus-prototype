 @item{a pattern constructor, which takes as many patterns as the
   supplied @rhombus[field]s and matches an instance of the class where the
   fields match the corresponding patterns;},

 @item{a dot povider to access accessor functions @rhombus[identifier.field]},

 @item{an annotation constructor @rhombus[identifier.of], which takes as
   many annotation arguments as supplied @rhombus[field]s.}
