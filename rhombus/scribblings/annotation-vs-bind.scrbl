@title[~tag: "annotation-vs-bind"]{Annotations versus Binding Patterns}

Annotations and binding patterns serve similar and interacting purposes.
The @rhombus[-:] and @rhombus[::] binding operators put annotations to
work in a binding. For the other direction, the @rhombus[matching]
annotation operator puts a binding form to work in a annotation.

For example, suppose you want a annotation @rhombus[PersonList], which
is a list of maps, and each map must at least relate @rhombus["name"] to
a @rhombus[String] and @rhombus["location"] to a @rhombus[Posn]. The
@rhombus[Map.of] annotation combination cannot express a per-key
specialization, but the @rhombus[Map] binding pattern can.

@(rhombusblock:
    annotation.macro 'PersonList: 
      '(List.of(matching(Map(~name: (_ :: String),
                             ~location: (_ :: Posn)))))

    val players :: PersonList:
      [Map(~name: "alice", ~location: Posn(1, 2)),
       Map(~name: "bob", ~location: Posn(3, 4))]
  )

As another example, hereâ€™s how a @rhombus[ListOf] annotation constructor
could be implemented if @rhombus[List.of] did not exists already:

@(rhombusblock:
    annotation.macro '(ListOf ($annotation ...) $tail ......):
      values('(matching([_ :: ($annotation ...), $(' ...)])),
             tail)
  )

At a lower level, the bridge between binding patterns and annotations is
based on their shared use of @seclink["static-info"]{static information}
as described in the @seclink["bind-macro-protocol"]{binding API} and the
@seclink["annotation-macro"]{annotation API}.
