 Defines @rhombus(identifier) or @rhombus(operator) as a binding form,
 which is implemented pattern-based macro whose expansion is described
 by a @rhombus(template) that can refer to pattern variables bound in
 the @rhombus(rule_pattern). The @rhombus(rule_pattern) and
 @rhombus(template) forms are the same as for @rhombus(expr.rule).

@examples(
  ~eval: macro_eval,
  bind.rule 'many $ann as $id':
    '$id && [_ :: $ann, $('...')]',
  val many Integer as tickets: [1, 2, 3],
  tickets,
  ~error val many String as names: "oops",
)

 Like @rhombus(expr.macro), but the first result of the transformer
 can be a low-level binding description created with
 @rhombus(bind_meta.pack).

 See @secref("bind-macro-protocol") for examples.

@doc(
  fun bind_meta.pack(stx :: Syntax) :: Syntax
){

 @provided_meta()

 Packs binding information that is represented by a syntax object with
 two parts: @rhombus(infoer_id, ~var) and @rhombus(data, ~var),
 combined in the form

 @(rhombusblock:
    '($$(@rhombus(infoer_id, ~var)), $$(@rhombus(data, ~var)))')

 The @rhombus(infoer_id, ~var) identifier must be bound to a transformer
 with @rhombus(bind.infoer), and @rhombus(data, ~var) is propagated to
 that transformer to get initial binding information and further
 ``continuations'' for generating matching and variable-defining forms.

 The representation of packed information as a syntax object is
 unspecified and meant to be opaque.

 See @secref("bind-macro-protocol") for more explanation and for
 examples.

}

@doc(
  fun bind_meta.unpack(stx :: Syntax) :: Syntax
){

 @provided_meta()

 The inverse of @rhombus(bind_meta.pack), normally used only internally in
 the expander.

}

@doc(
  defn.macro '«bind.infoer '$identifier($static_info_pattern, $data_pattern)':
                 $body
                 ...»'
){

 Defines @rhombus(identifier) as the infoer ``continuation'' of a
 binding macro's implementation. The inforer is invoked with ``upward''
 static information provided by the context of a use of the binding form,
 plus the same data syntax object that was supplied as part of the
 argument to @rhombus(bind_meta.pack). The transformer's result is
 automatically unpacked via @rhombus(bind_meta.pack_info), so it should be
 a syntax object that is suitable to pack---which means that it encodes
 information about identifiers to be boound as well as furtyher
 ``continuations'' in the form of a matcher transformer defined with
 @rhombus(bind.matcher) and binder transformer defined with
 @rhombus(bind.binder).

 See @secref("bind-macro-protocol") for more explanation and for
 examples.

}

@doc(
  fun bind_meta.pack_info(stx :: Syntax) :: Syntax
){

 @provided_meta()

 Packs binding information that specific to a use of a binding form,
 which means that ``upward'' has been provided to an infoer, and the
 infoer converts that to initial information about bindings plus
 ``continuations'' to generate the matching expression and variable
 definitions.

 The syntax object @rhombus(stx) must have the following shape:

 @(rhombusblock:
    '($$(@rhombus(ann_string, ~var)),
      $$(@rhombus(name_identifier, ~var)),
      (($$(@rhombus(static_key, ~var)), $$(@rhombus(static_value, ~var))), ...),
      (($$(@rhombus(defined_identifier, ~var)),
        ($$(@rhombus(var_static_key, ~var)), $$(@rhombus(var_static_value, ~var))), ...),
       ...),
      $$(@rhombus(matcher_id, ~var)),
      $$(@rhombus(binder_id, ~var)),
      $$(@rhombus(data, ~var)))'
   )

 The @rhombus(ann_string, ~var) term is for error repoting when a value
 fails to match the binding. It describes the binder's match requires in
 the form of an annotation.

 The @rhombus(name_identifier, ~var) term is for error reporting and
 reflection in the sense that it is used as the inferred name for a value
 matched to the binder, in case such a name is relevant.

 The @rhombus(static_key, ~var)--@rhombus(static_value, ~var) pairs
 describe ``upward'' static information for anything that successfully
 matches the binding. The ``upward'' information can be useful to an
 enclosing binding form.

 The @rhombus(defined_identifier, ~var)s are the identifiers that are
 ultimately bound by the binding form. Each identifier to be defined has
 associated ``downward'' static information through the
 @rhombus(var_static_key, ~var)--@rhombus(var_static_value, ~var) pairs.

 The @rhombus(matcher_id) and @rhombus(binder_id) identifiers provide
 the ``continuation'' of the binder's expansion to generate a matching
 expression and a definition sequence.

 The @rhombus(data) term is propoagated to the use of
 @rhombus(matcher_id) and @rhombus(binder_id), providing a communication
 channel from an infoer to a matcher and binder.
 
 The representation of packed information as a syntax object is
 unspecified and meant to be opaque.

 See @secref("bind-macro-protocol") for more explanation and for
 examples.

@doc(
  fun bind_meta.unpack_info(stx :: Syntax) :: Syntax
){

 @provided_meta()

 The inverse of @rhombus(bind_meta.pack_info), which is useful for
 unpacking information about the expansion of nested binding forms
 as produced by @rhombus(bind_meta.get_info).

}

@doc(
  fun bind_meta.get_info(bind_stx :: Syntax,
                         static_info :: Syntax) :: Syntax
){

 @provided_meta()

 Initiates the expansion of the binding form represented by
 @rhombus(bind_stx) in a context that supplies thet ``upward'' static
 information represented by @rhombus(static_info).

 Static information is represented by a syntax object that has the
 following shape:

 @(rhombusblock:
    '(($$(@rhombus(key_id, ~var)), $$(@rhombus(val, ~var))), ...)')
 
 The result is a syntax object that represents the initial expansion of
 the binding form as a packed syntax object, whose form is unspecified
 and intended to be opaque. Use @rhombus(bind_meta.unpack_info) to convert
 the packed syntax object and expose information about the binding's
 expansion.

 See @secref("bind-macro-protocol") for an example.

@doc(
  defn.macro '«bind.matcher '$identifier($id_pattern, $data_pattern,
                                         $IF_pattern, $success_pattern, $fail_pattern)':
                 $body
                 ...»'
){

 Defines @rhombus(identifier) as the matcher ``continuation'' of a
 binding form's expansion. The result is an expression that inspects the
 value of the identifier matched to @rhombus(id_pattern) and uses the
 pieces matched by @rhombus(IF_pattern), @rhombus(success_pattern), and
 @rhombus(fail_pattern) to dispatch on match success or failure. The term
 matched to @rhombus(data_pattern) is whatever data the infoer included
 at the end of its result.

 See @secref("bind-macro-protocol") for more explanation and for
 examples.

}

@doc(
  defn.macro '«bind.binder '$identifier($id_pattern, $data_pattern)':
                 $body
                 ...»'
){

 Defines @rhombus(identifier) as the binder ``continuation'' of a
 binding form's expansion. The result is an sequence of definitions for
 the variables that are bound by the expander form, where
 @rhombus(id_pattern) holds the value that was matched by a matcher. If
 the matcher included any additional bindings around the success branch,
 then those bindings are in the enviornment of the definitions generated
 by this binder. The term matched to @rhombus(data_pattern) is whatever
 data the infoer included at the end of its result.

 See @secref("bind-macro-protocol") for more explanation and for
 examples.
