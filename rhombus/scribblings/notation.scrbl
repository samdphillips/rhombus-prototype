@title{Notation Overview}

@aside{If you install @tt{https://github.com/mflatt/shrubbery-rhombus-0.git},
  then you can use @litchar{#lang shrubbery} (not @litchar{#lang rhombus}
  for this part) to see how example shrubberies parse into an
  S-expression representation. Unfortunately, it needs a development
  version of Racket right now, so you may need to install a
  @hyperlink["https://snapshot.racket-lang.org/"]{snapshot build}.}

Numbers are decimal, either integer or floating-point, or they’re
hexadecimal integers written with @litchar{0x}:

@(rhombusblock:
    0
    42
    -42
    1_048_576
    3.14157
    .5
    6.022e23
    0xf00ba7ba2)

Identifiers are Unicode alphanumeric and @litchar{_} with an initial
character that is not numeric.

@(rhombusblock:
    pi
    scissor7
    π
    underscore_case
    camelCase)

These characters are used for shrubbery structure and are
mostly not available for use in operators:

@verbatim[~indent: 2]|{
( ) [ ] { }   ; ,   : |   « »  \   " ~  # @
}|

The @litchar{:} and @litchar{|} characters can be used as part of an
operator, and any other Unicode punctuation or symbol character is fair
game for an operator:

@(rhombusblock:
    +
    .
    ->
    >=
    !^$&%$)

To avoid potential confusion with operators alongside numbers, however,
an operator that ends in @litchar{+}, @litchar{-}, or @litchar{.} must
consist only of that character. So, @litchar{++} and @litchar{...} are
operators, but @litchar{!+} is not. Similar problems happen with
comments, so an operator cannot contain @litchar{//} or @litchar{/*} or
have multiple characters and end in @litchar{/}.

Keywords are like identifiers, but prefixed with @litchar{~} and no space:

@(rhombusblock:
   ~base
   ~stronger_than)

Booleans:

@(rhombusblock:
    #true
    #false)


Strings and byte strings:

@(rhombusblock:
    "This is a string, just like you’d expect"
    #"a byte string")

Comments are C-style, but block comments are nestable:

@(rhombusblock:«
    // This is a line comment

    /* This is a multiline
       comment that /* continues */
       on further lines */
  »)

If you need anything more at the lexeme level (such as fancier numbers),
escape to S-expression notation with @litchar|{#{}| ... @litchar|{}}|.

Shrubbery notation is whitespace-sensitive, and it uses line breaks and
indentation for grouping. A line with more indentation starts a
@emph{block}, and it’s always after a line that ends @litchar{:}, that
ends @litchar{|} (much less commonly), or that starts @litchar{|}. You
can think of a more-indented @litchar{|} as being preceded implicitly by
a @litchar{:} at the end of the previous line. A @litchar{|} counts as
being indented by half a column, so the @litchar{|}s below are indented
even when they are written right under @rhombus[if], @rhombus[match], or
@rhombus[cond]:

@(rhombusblock:
    begin:
      group within block
      another group within block

    if is_rotten(apple)
    | get_another()
    | take_bite()
      be_happy()
          
    match x
    | 0:
        def zero: x
        x + zero
    | n:
        n + 1

    cond
    | // check the weather
      is_raining():
        take_umbrella()
    | // check the destination
      going_to_beach():
        wear_sunscreen()
        take_umbrella()
    | // assume a hat is enough
      ~else:
        wear_hat() )

@aside{Even if you don’t normally use DrRacket, you should proabably try it
while reading this proposal, since that’s where the syntax coloring
and indentation support for `#lang shrubbery` and `#lang rhombus` are
currently implemented. Syntax coloring uses the same lexer as the
language’s implementation, so it can’t get out of sync. For
indentation, hit Tab to cycle through the possible indentations for a
line (based on preceding lines). If multiple lines are selected, then
Tab cycles through possibilities for the first selected line and
shifts remaining lines by same amount. There should be some way to
normalize indentation while preserving the current parse, but that’s
not yet implemented.}

A @litchar{|} is allowed only within a block, and it also starts a
subblock on the right-hand side of the @litchar{|}. Each subsequent
@litchar{|} at the same indentation creates a new subblock. Shrubbery
notation allows @litchar{|} only within a block whose groups all contain
an immediate @litchar{|} subblock. A block of @litchar{|} subblocks is
an @deftech{alts-block}. A @litchar{:} isn’t needed or allowed before
the first @litchar{|} in an alts-block, because the @litchar{|} itself
is enough of an indication that a alts-block is starting.

Each line within a block forms a @deftech{group}. Groups are important,
because parsing and macro expansion are constrained to operate on groups
(although a group can contain nested blocks, etc.). Groups at the same
level of indentation as a previous line continue that group’s block. A
@litchar{|} can have multiple groups in the subblock to its right, but
the block started by @litchar{|} turns out to be the only thing in its
own group.

A @litchar{:} doesn’t have to be followed by a new line, but it starts a
new block, anyway. Similarly, a @litchar{|} that starts a block doesn’t
have to be on a new line. These examples parse the same as the previous
examples:

@(rhombusblock:
    begin: group within block
           another group within block

    if is_rotten(apple) | get_another() | take_bite()
                                          be_happy()

    match x | 0: def zero: x
                 x + zero
            | n: n + 1

    cond | is_raining(): take_umbrella()
         | going_to_beach(): wear_sunscreen()
                             take_umbrella()
         | ~else: wear_hat() )

Within a block, a @litchar{;} can be used instead of a new line to start
a new group, so these examples also parse the same:

@(rhombusblock:
    begin: group within block; another group within block

    if is_rotten(apple) | get_another() | take_bite(); be_happy()

    match x | 0: def zero: x
                 x + zero
            | n: n + 1

    cond | is_raining(): take_umbrella()
         | going_to_beach(): wear_sunscreen(); take_umbrella()
         | ~else: wear_hat()  )

You can add extra @litchar{;}s, such as at the end of lines, since
@litchar{;} will never create an empty group.

Finally, anything that can be written with newlines and indentation can
be written on a single line, but @litchar{«} and @litchar{»} may be
required to delimit a block using @litchar{«} just after @litchar{:} or
@litchar{|} and @litchar{»} at the end of the block. Normally,
parentheses work just as well, but the `match` example above illustrates
a rare case where @litchar{«} and @litchar{»} would be needed to fit on
a single line. Without @litchar{«} and @litchar{»}, the following form
would put @rhombus[x + zero] insinde the definition of @rhombus[zero]:

@(rhombusblock:
    match x | 0: def zero:« x »; x + zero | n: n + 1)

Parentheses @litchar{(} ... @litchar{)}, square brackets @litchar{[} ...
@litchar{]}, and curly braces @litchar|{{}| ... @litchar|{}}| combine a
sequence of groups. A comma @litchar{,} can be used to separate groups
on one line between the opener and closer. Furthermore, a `,` is
_required_ to separate groups, even if they’re not on the same line. You
can’t have extra `,`s, except after the last group.

@(rhombusblock:
    f(1, 2,
      3, 4)

    ["apples",
     "bananas",
     "cookies",
     "milk"]

    map(add_five, [1, 2, 3, 4,]))

Indentation still works for creating blocks within @litchar{(} ... @litchar{)},
@litchar{[} ... @litchar{]}, or @litchar|{{}| ... @litchar|{}}|:

@(rhombusblock:
    map(fun (x):
          x + 5,
        [1, 2, 3, 4]) )

There are some subtleties related to the ``precedence'' of @litchar{:},
@litchar{|}, @litchar{;}, and @litchar{,}, but they’re likely to work as
you expect in a given example.
