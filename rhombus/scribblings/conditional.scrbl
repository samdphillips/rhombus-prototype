@title[~tag: "conditional"]{Conditionals and Pattern-Matching Dispatch}

The @rhombus[&&] and @rhombus[||] operators are short-circuiting ``and'' and ''or'' forms.
As in Racket, @rhombus[||] returns the first non-@rhombus[#false] value, and @rhombus[&&]
returns the last non-@rhombus[#false] value. 

@(rhombusblock:
    1 < 2 && "ok"  // prints "ok"
  )

Comparison operators and @rhombus[!] (for ``not'') have higher
precedence than @rhombus[&&] and @rhombus[||], while @rhombus[&&] has
higher precedence than @rhombus[||]. Arithmetic operators have higher
precedence than comparison operators, @rhombus[||], @rhombus[&&], but
they have no precedence relative to @rhombus[!]. The @rhombus[==]
operator is numerical comparison like Racket’s @tt{=}, while
@rhombus[===] operator is Racket’s @tt{equal?}. Comparison
operators are non-associative and have no precedence relationship with
each other.

The @rhombus[if] form expects a test expression followed by an
alts-block with two @litchar{|}s. The first @litchar{|} holds the
``then'' branch, and the second @litchar{|} holds the ``else'' branch:

@(rhombusblock:
    if 1 == 2
    | "same"
    | "different"
  )

Although an @rhombus[if] could be nested further in the ``else'' branch
to implement an ``if'' ... ``else if'' ... ``else if'' ... combination,
the @rhombus[cond] form supports that combination better. It expects an
alts-block where each @litchar{|} has a test expression followed by a
block. Evaluating the @rhombus[cond] form dispatches to the block after
first test that produces a non-@rhombus[#false] value. The
@rhombus[~else] keyword can be used in place of a last test.

@(rhombusblock:
    fun fib(n):
      cond
      | n == 0: 1
      | n == 1: 1
      | ~else: fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

    fib(5) // prints 8
  )

If there’s no @rhombus[~else] case and no matching case, then
@rhombus[cond] reports an error at run time (unlike Racket, which
returns void in that case). Note that @rhombus[~else] is a keyword, and
not an identifier. If it were an identifier, then @rhombus[else] might
get bound in some context to @rhombus[#false], which would be confusing.
As another special case, @rhombus[_] is allowed in place of
@rhombus[else]; although it is possible to bind @rhombus[_], it takes a
specifical effort because @rhombus[_] is a binding operator.

Although @rhombus[cond] is better than @rhombus[if] for @rhombus[fib],
the @rhombus[match] form is even better. The @rhombus[match] form
expects an expression and then an alts-block where each @litchar{|} has
a binding pattern followed by a block. The @rhombus[match] form
evaluates that first expression, and dispatches to the first block whose
pattern accepts the expression’s value. Similar to @rhombus[cond],
@rhombus[match] supports @rhombus[~else] in place of a final binding
pattern, but using the binding operator @rhombus[_] is more common.

@(rhombusblock:
    fun fib(n):
      match n
      | 0: 1
      | 1: 1
      | _: fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
  )

This kind of immediate pattern-matching dispatch on a function argument
is common enough that @rhombus[fun] supports it directly, fusing the
function declaration and the pattern match, like this:

@(rhombusblock:
    fun
    | fib(0): 1
    | fib(1): 1
    | fib(n): fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
  )

There’s no @rhombus[~else] for this fused form, but @rhombus[_, ~bind] can be
useful in catch-call clauses where the argument is not used. Also, the
function name and all relevant argument positions have to be repeated in
every case, but that’s often a readable trade-off. Match-dispatching
functions cannot have optional or keyword arguments, but different cases
can have different numbers of arguments, and a call will find a matching
case with the right number of arguments.

@(rhombusblock:
    fun
    | hello(name):
        "Hello, " & name    // & coerces to strings and concatenates
    | hello(first, last):
        hello(first & " " & last)

    hello("World")             // prints "Hello, World"
    hello("Inigo", "Montoya")  // prints "Hello, Inigo Montoya"
  )
