 Defines @rhombus[identifier] or @rhombus[operator] as a pattern-based
 macro whose expansion is described by a @rhombus[template] that can
 refer to pattern variables bound in the @rhombus[rule_pattern]. A
 @rhombus[rule_pattern] is matched to a portion of its enclosing group,
 and need not extend to the end of the group to match.

 Each @rhombus[rule_pattern] starts with @rhombus['] followed by either
 an identifier or by parentheses. An identifier by itself is defined as a
 ``nofix'' macro, which is the same as a prefix operator that consumes no
 arguments. With parentheses after @rhombus['], either the first term is
 an identifier or operator to be defined as a prefix macro, or a single
 @rhombus[$, ~bind] escape is followed by the identifier or operator to
 be defined as an infix macro.

 Using @litchar{|} alternatives, a single definition can have any number
 of prefix and infix variants (presumably) distinguished by patterns that
 are tried in order.

 The body after each @rhombus[rule_pattern] must be an immediate
 @rhombus['] template, and any @rhombus[$] escape within the template can
 only refer to an input pattern variable. More general compile-time
 expressions are not allowed, and @rhombus[expr.macro] must be used
 instead.

 Provided @rhombus[for_meta, ~impmod], a value that can be used to
 associate static information with an expression that describes the
 result value if the expression is used as a function to call.
