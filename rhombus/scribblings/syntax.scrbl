@title[~tag: "syntax"]{Syntax Objects}

The @rhombus[''] form produces a syntax object. The syntax object holds
an unparsed shrubbery, not a parsed Rhombus expression.

@(rhombusblock:
    '1'          // prints a shrubbery: 1
    'hello'      // prints a shrubbery: hello
    '1 + 2'      // prints a shrubbery: 1 + 2
    'x:
       y'       // prints a shrubbery: x:« y »
    // '1' + 2  // would be a run-time error, since '1 is not a number
  )

The @rhombus[''] form is more precisely a quasiquoting operator. The
@rhombus[$] unquotes the immediate following terms. That is, the term
after @rhombus[$] is a Rhombus expression whose value replaces the
@rhombus[$] and its argument within the quoted form.

@(rhombusblock:
    '1 + $(2 + 3)'  // prints a shrubbery: 1 + 5
  )

A @rhombus[$] only unquotes when it is followed by a term, otherwise the @rhombus[$]
itself remains quoted.

@(rhombusblock:
    '1 + $('$') 2'  // prints a shrubbery: 1 + $ 2
  )

@aside{Nested @rhombus[''] does not increase the quoting level like
 Racket quasiquote.}

Like @rhombus[$], @rhombus[...] is treated specially within a @rhombus['']-quoted term (except,
like @rhombus[$], when it’s the only thing in the term). When @rhombus[...] immediately
follows a term that includes at least one @rhombus[$], the value of the
expression after that @rhombus[$] must produce a list of syntax objects. Then,
instead of the parenthesized group in place of @rhombus[$], the term before
@rhombus[...] is replicated as many times as the list has items, and each of
those items is used in one replication.

@(rhombusblock:
    def seq: ['1', '2', '3']

    '(hi $seq) ...' // prints a shrubbery: (hi 1) (hi 2) (hi 3)
  )

There’s a subtlety here: could @rhombus[seq] have zero elements? If so,
replicating the @rhombus[hi] form zero times within a group would leave
an empty group, but a shrubbery never has an empty group. To manage this
gap, a @rhombus[$] replication to a group with zero terms generates a
multi-group syntax object with zero groups. Attempting to generate a group
with no terms within a larger sequence with multiple groups is an error.

@(rhombusblock:
    def seq: []

    '(hi $seq) ...'           // prints an empty shrubbery
    // 'x; (hi $seq) ...; y'  // would be a run-time error
  )

When @rhombus[...] is the only term in a group, and when that group follows
another, then @rhombus[...] replicates the preceding group. For example,
putting @rhombus[...] after a @litchar{,} in parentheses means that it follows a the
group before the @litchar{,}, which effectively replicates that group with its
separating comma:

@(rhombusblock:
    def seq: ['1', '2', '3']

    '(hi $seq, ...)' // prints a shrubbery: (hi 1, hi 2, hi 3)
  )

Along the same lines, @rhombus[...] just after a @litchar{|} can replicate a preceding
@litchar{|} block:

@(rhombusblock:
    def seq: ['1', '2', '3']

    'cond | $seq | ...' // prints a shrubbery: cond |« 1  »|« 2  »|« 3 »
  )

In other words, @rhombus[...] in various places within a quoted shrubbery
works the way you’d expect it to work.

When @rhombus[''] is used in a binding position, it constructs a pattern that
matches syntax objects, and it binds variables that are escaped in the
pattern with @rhombus[$].

@(rhombusblock:
    val '$x + $y': '1 + (2 + 3)'

    x  // prints a shrubbery: 1
    y  // prints a shrubbery: (2 + 3)
  )

A @rhombus[$]-escaped variable in a @rhombus[''] pattern matches one term if
the group with the @rhombus[$] escape has other terms. Keep in mind
that @rhombus[''] creates syntax objects containing shrubberies that are not
yet parsed, so a variable will not be matched to a multi-term sequence
that would be parsed as an expression. For example, a pattern variable
@rhombus[y] by itself cannot be matched to a sequence @rhombus[2 + 3]:

@(rhombusblock:«
    // val '$x + $y': '1 + 2 + 3'  // would be a run-time error
  »)

If a @rhombus[$] escape is alone within its group, however, the
@rhombus[$]-escaped variable stands for a match to an entire group.

@(rhombusblock:
    val '$x': '1 + 2 + 3'
    x  // prints a shrubbery group: 1 + 2 + 3
    )

A group syntax object can be substituted into a template when the escape
to substitute is similarly in its own group. Attempting to substitute a
multi-term group in any other template context is an error.

@(rhombusblock:
    val '$x': '1 + 2 + 3'
    '[$x]'     // prints a shrubbery: [1 + 2 + 3]
    // '[0 + $x]'  // would be a run-time error
  )

At the same time, a group syntax object that has a single term in the
group is interchangeable with a single-term syntax object:

@(rhombusblock:
    val '$y': '1'
    '[$y]'      // prints a shrubbery: [1]
    '[0 + $y]'  // prints a shrubbery: [0 + 1]
  )

To match a single term in a group context, annotate the pattern variable
with the @rhombus[Term, ~stxclass] syntax class using the @rhombus[::] operator.

@(rhombusblock:
    val '$(x :: Term)': '1'
    x  // prints a shrubbery: 1

    // val '$(x :: Term)': '1 + 2' // would be an run-time error
  )

If a @rhombus[$] escape is not only alone within its group, but the
group is the only one in a sequence of groups, then the
@rhombus[$]-escaped variable stands for a match to an entire sequence of
groups. In a template, when a group-sequence context has a single group
with only an escape in the group, then it can be filled with a
multi-group syntax object. There is no contraint that the original and
destination contexts have the same shape, so a match from a block-like
context can be put into brackets context, for example.

@(rhombusblock:
    val '$x': '1 + 2 + 3
               4 * 5 * 6'
    '[$x]'     // prints a shrubbery: [1 + 2 + 3, 4 * 5 * 6]
  )

In the same way that a single-term syntax object can be used as a group
syntax object, a single-group syntax object can be used as a multi-group
syntax object, and a single-term syntax object can be used as a
multi-term syntax object. Use the @rhombus[Group,~stxclass] syntax class
to match a single group instead of a multi-group sequence.

Meanwhile, @rhombus[..., ~bind] works the way you would expect in a
pattern, matching any @rhombus[..., ~bind]-replicated pattern variables
to form a list of matches:

@(rhombusblock:
    val '$x + $y ...': '1 + 2 + 3'

    x  // prints a shrubbery: 1
    y  // prints a list: ['2, ' +, '3]
  )

A @rhombus[......, ~bind] behaves similarly to @rhombus[..., ~bind], but
for a @deftech{tail replication} that can only appear at the end of a
group. In a patttern, an escaped variable must appear before
@rhombus[......, ~bind], and instead of binding the variable to a list, the
variable is bound to a syntax object for a parenthesized term that
contains the matched tail. In a template, an escaped expression must
appear before @rhombus[......, ~bind], and it must produce a syntax object for
a parenthesized term.

Use @rhombus[......, ~bind] for tail sequences that you don’t need to inspect,
because the syntax-object representation can avoid work proportional to
the length of the matched tail. Avoiding that work can be important for
macros.

@(rhombusblock:
    val '$head $tail ......': '1 2 3 4 5'

    head  // prints a shrubbery: 1
    tail  // prints a shrubbery: 2 3 4 5
    '0 $tail ......' // prints a shrubbery: 0 2 3 4 5
  )

@aside{Using @rhombus[......, ~bind] is similar to using @litchar{.} in
 S-expression patterns and templates. The difference can avoid quadratic
 expansion costs, which is all the more important in the Rhombus
 expansion protocol, which must thread potentially long sequences into
 and out of macro transformers.}
