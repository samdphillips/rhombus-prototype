@title[~tag: "for"]{Iteration}

Rhombus support a proper implementation of tail-call handling (i.e.,
tail calls do not extend the continuation), so looping can be written as
a recursive function. Nevertheless, a looping construct is convenient
and useful for writing many kinds of iterations.

The @rhombus[for] form supports iteration over @deftech{sequences},
which includes lists, arrays, and maps. In the body of a @rhombus[for]
form, each @rhombus[~each] clause binds to an element of a sequence for
each iteration. The length of the sequence determines the number of
iterations. The @rhombus[..] operator creates a sequence of integers
from a starting integer (inclusive) to an ending integer (exclusive):

@demo[
  for:
    ~each i: 1..4
    displayln(i)
]

If a @rhombus[for] body includes multiple @rhombus[~each] clauses, they
are nested. That is, for each element of the first @rhombus[~each] clause,
all elements are used for the second @rhombus[~each] clause, and so on.

@demo[
  for:
    ~each friend: ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]
    ~each say: ["Hello", "Goodbye"]
    displayln(say & ", " & friend & "!")
]

An advantage of having @rhombus[~each] clauses in the body of
@rhombus[for], instead of putting them before the body as in many other
languages, is that definitions or expressions can be written among
@rhombus[~each] clauses.

@demo[
  for:
    ~each friend: ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]
    val dear_friend: "dear " & friend
    ~each say: ["Hello", "Goodbye"]
    displayln(say & ", " & dear_friend & "!")
]

To draw elements from sequences in parallel, use @rhombus[~and]
instead of @rhombus[~each] for every additional sequence.

@demo[
  for:
    ~each friend: ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]
    ~and  index: 1..4
    displayln(index & ". " & friend)
]

In this latest example, the sequence for @rhombus[index] could be
@rhombus[1..] to avoid needing the length of the list for
@rhombus[friend]. When @rhombus[..] has no second argument, it creates
an infinite sequence of integers, and when @rhombus[for] iterates over
sequences in parallel, it stops when the shortest sequence stops.

The @rhombus[for] form acts as a comprehension form when a
@deftech{folder} is specified before the @rhombus[for] body block.
@rhombus[List, ~folder] serves as a folder to generate a list,
accumulating the values produced by each iteration of the @rhombus[for]
body.

@demo[
  for List:
    ~each i: 1..4
    "number " & i,
  for List:
    ~each i: [1, 2]
    ~each j: ["a", "b", "c"]
    [i, j]
]

@rhombus[Map, ~folder] works as a folder where the body of the
@rhombus[for] form must produce two values for each iteration: a key and
a value.

@demo[
  for Map:
    ~each friend: ["alice", "bob", "carol"]
    ~and  index: 1..
    values(index, friend)
]

The @rhombus[values, ~folder] folder implements the general case, where
@rhombus[values] is followed by a parenthesized sequence of identifiers
with initial values, the @rhombus[for] body can refer to those
identifiers to get values from the previous iteration (or the initial
values in the case of the first iteration), and the @rhombus[for] body
returns as many values as identifiers to provide new values for the
identifiers.

@demo[
  fun sum(l -: List):
    for values(sum = 0):
      ~each i: l
      sum+i,
  sum([2, 3, 4])
]

In the same way that a @rhombus[List, ~ann] annotation specializes
element access via @litchar{[}...@litchar{]}, it also specializes how
@rhombus[~each] within @rhombus[for] iterates through a list. In the
following example, @rhombus[ll] is annotated as a list of lists, so both
the outer and inner iterations are specialized---although that
specialization is visible only as a change in performance, if at all.

@demo[
  fun sum2d(ll -: List.of(List.of(Number))):
    for values(sum = 0):
      ~each l: ll
      ~each i: l
      sum+i,
  sum2d([[1], [2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9]])
]
