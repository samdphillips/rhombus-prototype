@title[~tag: "set"]{Sets}

When @litchar["{"]...@litchar["}"] is used with elements that do not
have @rhombus[:], then @litchar["{"]...@rhombus["}"] creates a set. (If
a set-element expression uses @rhombus[:], then it will need to be in
parentheses to avoid being parsed as a keyâ€“value pair.) A set can serve
as a map, where the set's elements act as keys and each key's value is
@rhombus[#true]. There's a @rhombus[Set] constructor that's analogous to
@rhombus[Map], but @rhombus[Set] accepts just values to include in the
set. The @rhombus[++] operator effectively unions sets.

@(rhombusblock:
    val friends: {"alice", "bob", "carol"}

    if friends["alice"] && friends["carol"]
    | "I know both"
    | "Who are they?"
    // prints "I know both"

    val new_friends: friends ++ {"david"}
    new_friends["david"]  // prints #true
    friends["david"]      // prints #false
  )

@rhombus[Set.of] and @rhombus[make_set] work as you'd expect. When
@litchar{[}...@litchar{]} with @rhombus[=] is used to modify a mutable
set, the ``key'' is removed from the set if the assigned value is
@rhombus[#false], otherwise the ``key'' is added to the set.
