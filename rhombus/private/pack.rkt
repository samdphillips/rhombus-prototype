;; We represent Rhombus syntax objects as a syntax object with one of
;; the following forms:
;;   (multi (group term ...) ...) - as a general multi-group syntax object
;;   (group term ...) - for a group syntax object
;;   term - for a single-term syntax object
;; Coercions among these happen automatically. So, the Rhombus expression
;;   'x'
;; could be represented for most purposes as #'(multi (group x)) or just #'x.

;; "Pack" means going form the internal Racket-side representation to
;; the Rhombus repesentation, such as when sending syntax to a
;; Rhombus-implemented macro, and "unpack" means going back.

;; "Tail" below refers to the argument to a macro for the rest of the
;; enclosing sequence. We represent it using `multi` on the Rhombus
;; side, but it's just a list on the Racket side, which means adding
;; both `group` and them `multi` to get from here to there. On the way
;; back, we coerce from any of the three possible shapes, containing
;; `multi` to a single group.

;; When we "unpack" here, group unpacking is asymmetric and is really
;; just about coercsions, mot about removing a `group` wrapper.
