@title{Shrubbery Notation}

Shrubbery notation is a set of text-level convention that build toward a
full programming language, such as
@seclink(~doc: [symbol(lib), "rhombus/scribblings/rhombus.scrbl"], "top"){Rhombus}.
The notation is line- and indentation-sensitive, and it is intended to partially group
input, but leave further parsing to another layer, especially
@seclink(~doc: [symbol(lib), "enforest/scribblings/enforest.scrbl"], "top"){enforestation}.
The parsed form of a shrubbery imposes grouping to ensure that further
parsing is consistent with the shrubbery's lines and indentation.
