@title[~tag: "example"]{Examples}

Here are some example shrubberies. Each line either uses old indentation
to continue a nesting level that was started on a previous line, starts
with new indentation and follows a line that ends with @litchar{:}, or
starts with new indentation and a @litchar{|} on the same line. A
@litchar{:} or @litchar{|} can also appear in the middle of a line, but
that's roughly a shorthand for starting a new indented line after the
@litchar{:} or before the @litchar{|}. The complete rules involve more
terminology, but that's enough to get a sense of the examples.

@(rhombusblock:
    def identity(x): x

    def fib(n):
      cond
      | n == 0: 0
      | n == 1: 1
      | ~else: fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

    def print_sexp(v):
      match v
      | empty: display("()")
      | cons(a, d):
          if is_list(d)
          | display("(")
            print_sexp(a)
            for (v = in_list(d)):
              display(" ")
              print_sexp(v)
            display(")")
          | display("(")
            print_sexp(a)
            display(". ")
            print_sexp(d)
            display(")")
      | v: print_atom(v)
  )

Forms like @litchar{def}, @litchar{cond}, and @litchar{match} are not
specified by shrubbery notation, since specifying those forms is up to a
language that is built on top of shrubbery notation. Still, shrubbery
notation is meant to accommodate a particular kind of syntax for nested
blocks (via @litchar{:} and indentation) and conditional blocks (via
@litchar{|}).

Identifiers are C-style with alphanumerics and underscores. Operators
are sequences of symbolic characters in the sense of
@litchar{char-symbolic?}, roughly. No spaces are needed between
operators and non-operators, so @litchar{1+2} and @litchar{1 + 2} mean
the same thing. Comments are C-style. See @secref["lexeme-parsing"]
for more information.

The following tokens are used for grouping, in addition to line breaks
and indentation:

@verbatim[~indent: 2]{
( ) [ ] { }  ; ,   : |   « »  \
}

Parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces are used to delimit
groups in the obvious way. A @litchar{;} or @litchar{,} acts as a group
separator, even within a single line. A @litchar{:} or @litchar{|}
treats remaining item on the same line like a new indented line, which
forms a block of nested groups. A guillemot pair @litchar{«} and @litchar{»} can be
used in rare cases to explicitly bracket subgroups formed by
@litchar{:} and @litchar{|} without line breaks. A @litchar{\} continues
a line, effectively shifting all columns on the next line as if they
appeared immediately after the @litchar{\}.
